I discovered my passion for Computer Science during high school, and was fortunate enough to continue my studies at UIC.  
In my classes, I have been able to learn C, C++, and have been using my skills in private projects to develop my back-end programming and Computer Vision skills.  
I am currently learning Assembly, and have been fortunate enough to be the recepient of the President's Award Program as well as the UIC Logmaster Scholarship.  
As I progress through school, I am hoping to develop Cybersecurity-oriented skills and join a Chicago-based company that defends people against threats.
